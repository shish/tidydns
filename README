app/
  contains a python application based on web.py, running the script should
  cause a web server to open on port 8080 (?)

db/
  has ddns.db, an SQLite3 database, with tables:

  CREATE TABLE user(
  	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
	username VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
	password CHAR(32) NOT NULL
  );
  CREATE TABLE domain(
  	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
	name TEXT NOT NULL,
	serial INTEGER NOT NULL
  );
  CREATE TABLE record(
  	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
	user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
	name TEXT NOT NULL,
	domain TEXT NOT NULL,
	address TEXT NOT NULL,
	last_update INTEGER NOT NULL
  );

htdocs/
  static files to serve

logs/
  where the application log will go, and web server logs if your web server
  is set up that way

run/
  a startup script if you want to use tidydns with runit; the script runs
  the app in fastcgi unix socket mode for nginx to connect to

tidydns.org.zone
  an example bind zone file, stuff before ";; start dynamic ;;" is left as it
  is, stuff after the marker is generated from the database


Other notes:

tidydns needs to be able to reload the bind config, so in /etc/sudoers

tddnsusername ALL=NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/bind9 reload
