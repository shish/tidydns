<h1>TIny DYnamic DNS</h1>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>$ curl http://shish:mcpassword@master4.tidydns.org/marigold
ok: marigold.tidydns.org = 81.171.46.249

$ curl http://shish:mcpassword@master6.tidydns.org/marigold-v6
ok: marigold-v6.tidydns.org = 2002:51ab:2ef9::1

$ ping marigold.tidydns.org
PING marigold.tidydns.org (81.171.46.249) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from marigold.shishnet.org (81.171.46.249): icmp_seq=1 ttl=53 time=39.5 ms
64 bytes from marigold.shishnet.org (81.171.46.249): icmp_seq=2 ttl=53 time=55.0 ms

</pre>

<h3>That is all</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Username / password will be recorded the first time they're used (password update / recover-by-email coming soon)
	<li>Subdomains are added as used
	<li>Free for basic use (if you're getting millions of hits per day, you
	should probably have your own server anyway)
	<li>Beta quality :-P (It should work fine, but don't sue me if it breaks)
	<li>More domains can be added (something tiny if people want,
	ddns.yourbusiness.com if you want dynamic dns for your business, etc)
</ul>

<h3>Why?</h3>
I wanted IPv6 compatible dynamic DNS for my
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_tunneling">teredo</a>-enabled
laptop &amp; desktop; all the other dynamic dns providers were IPv4 only,
non-free, or a pain to work with. It nearly counts as revision for my networking
exam in a couple of weeks too \o/
